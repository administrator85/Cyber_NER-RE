## Introduction

In the realm of cybersecurity, data is abundant but often unstructured. Our **Cyber_NER-RE** system addresses this challenge by applying advanced machine learning techniques to extract relevant entities such as IP addresses, domain names, and malware types from unstructured text. Additionally, it identifies relationships between these entities, providing a clearer picture of cyber threats and incidents.

## Features

- **Named Entity Recognition**: Accurately identifies entities relevant to cybersecurity, including:
  - IP addresses
  - Domain names
  - Malware types
  - Attack vectors
- **Relation Extraction**: Discovers relationships between identified entities, such as:
  - Associations between malware and attack vectors
  - Links between IP addresses and domains
- **Customizable Models**: Allows users to train models on their own datasets to improve accuracy and relevance.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Easy-to-use interface for running NER and RE tasks.
- **Performance Metrics**: Provides detailed metrics to evaluate the model's performance.
